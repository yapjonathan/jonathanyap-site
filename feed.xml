        <title>Emotivu</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/emotivu-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;Emotivu responsive app&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;movie-recommendation-based-on-your-status-update&quot;&gt;Movie recommendation based on your status update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emotivu was the result of Startup Weekend in 2012, an ambitious project that bring emotions, tweets, and movies together. Using sentiment analysis and a complex algorithm, Emotivu recommends you movies to watch based on your tweets. This was the initial proof of concept that slowly evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a team of 3, my task was to focus on UX/UI and front end. One of the toughest challenge was making the app responsive, as it involves planning for cross browser and cross devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/emotivu-wireframe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Emotivu wireframe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user flow was vital in helping build the algorithm, as it requires a lot of user feedback to help it learn and improve recommendation and accuracy. We went through countless number of iteration to archive the right balance of feedback and usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/emotivu-menu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Emotivu menu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSS animation was big. Big in terms of how well it performed over all browsers and devices. My target was to avoid using javascript to drive all the animation as it drops a huge amount of frame rates on mobile devices. CSS3 performed brilliantly across most devices, with devices that did not support it would simply gracefully degrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our app is far from finish as we pressed on to work on getting Emotivu closer to how we pictured it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tronsquare</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/tronsquare-map.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Transquare Map&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/tronsquare-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Transquare Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;light-cycle-game-using-location-check-ins&quot;&gt;Light cycle game using location check-ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happen when you mash up the light cycle game from Tron and Foursquare. The idea of Tronsquare first came at the Unlock London Hackathon and the following day it won in the category of Most Innovative Application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team then came together to mash out awesomeness and put everything in full swing. Consisting of myself, an iOS developer, an Android developer, a web developer and an end point server side developer, each of us worked on our strength to create a game worthy of the Grid. In an AGILE environment, I lead the UX/UI development in making the game itself worked before polishing the UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our on going efforts in getting the prototype working has took us closer and closer to our vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/tronsquare-logotype.png&quot; alt=&quot;Transquare Logotype&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the logo itself, I created a logotype that will accompany the app icon, in application where the logo would not work as well on its on. It took some time and micro tweaking to get it to the way it should be without looking out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/tronsquare-wireframe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Transquare Wireframe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early wireframe did helped the team understand and improve the whole user journey. This helped us identify problems early on which helped on iterating features to include in roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have kept the app simple and basic as our first prototype as our focus was to overcome a lot of development and technical challenges. This proved to be a challenge for myself in terms of the visual aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/tronsquare-lights.png&quot; alt=&quot;Transquare Lights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the right colour and glow wasn’t easy. It took quite a lot of effort to get the consistency of light across the UI right. It is essential that the colour also add an element of interactivity and feedback to gamers. This was an opportunity to turn something basic to something that shared the similar aesthetic as the vision in the Grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/tronsquare-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;Transquare App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the final outlook of the app, in all its pixel glory. Though, there are still a lot more work to be done in the coming days&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>O2 Academy App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/o2-academy-intro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;O2 Academy Concept shot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bringing-you-closer-to-the-music&quot;&gt;Bringing you closer to the music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project started out as a simple refresh in design and added functionality for both iOS and Android. It grew into an opportunity to add value in the O2 music experience. This also helped us rethink the presentation method and a more engaging way to tell a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/o2-academy-old-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;O2 Academy app older version&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start of this project was to propose an improvement to the previous version and give it a much needed facelift to be inline with the O2 Academy brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/o2-academy-new-concept.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;O2 Academy app new concept&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its about the journey from the excitement of getting the tickets to anticipation of attending the big day to the eagerness of finding the next gig. Every event is different and every artist is unique, so an adaptive approach to the app is introduced. The Band Pack. We took this opportunity to present the idea in a different light, in the experience of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/o2-academy-new-concept2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;O2 Academy app new concept 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We constructed a set that mimics the music cycle and introduced elements that enhance the experience. Through the set, we were able to communicate an engaging story and paint a much clearer picture in an exciting way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/o2-academy-persona.gif&quot; alt=&quot;O2 Academy persona character&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really helped the client understand and engage in the idea. We were able to encourage a lot of healthy discussion through this little guy, putting the perspective of the user at the centre of the attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introducing-bandpack&quot;&gt;Introducing Bandpack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/o2-academy-new-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;O2 Academy app new app&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the focus now on the event itself, we introduce an element called the Band Pack that allow artists to showcase themselves. This allow the app to pull in customised content that tailors to the personality of the artist. We also provide a complete view by pull in relevant information about the performing venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/o2-academy-new-app2.png&quot; alt=&quot;O2 Academy app new app 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it easy to pull in information and invite friends to join up for a night of excitement. In conclusion, the idea is about bringing you closer to the music through mobile and we have successfully created the right conversation with the client while discovering a unique way to showcase ideas and creating discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Panasonic In-Flight Entertainment System</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/panasonic-ex3-intro.png&quot; alt=&quot;Panasonic Ex3 Intro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-framework-of-entertainment-in-the-skies&quot;&gt;Building a framework of entertainment in the skies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project with Panasonic is a very large scale, long term collaboration which involves a lot of people. I was involved in building the experience from ground up and helped shape the standards for a complex B2B CMS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;android-powered-entertainment&quot;&gt;Android powered entertainment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/panasonic-ex3-ife-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;Panasonic Ex3 IFE designs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This started out with the work for building the UI in the Ex3 in-flight entertainment (IFE) system. With the latest version allowing touch interaction and wireless internet in the skies, we could pull in a lot of familiar services for those long hours up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/panasonic-ex3-ife-wireframes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Panasonic Ex3 IFE wireframes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project then grew into providing a second screen experience in extension to the back seat IFE. We drew up multiple mini wireframes sets to help create second screen UX for users with tablet devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/panasonic-ex3-sb-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Panasonic Ex3 IFE site builder logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the project is creating an automate process for airline without much additional coding, by building a content management system for site portals. It all starts with a simple logo, with an added bonus of allowing version control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/panasonic-ex3-sb.png&quot; alt=&quot;Panasonic Ex3 IFE site builder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followed by a tool to use that is build with speed and performance in mind. This CSS lead design took inspiration from flat design, which fits the criteria of cross browser performance and implementation. It was about designing a tool to build and not hinder performance with bloated UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;extending-the-portal-capability&quot;&gt;Extending the portal capability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/panasonic-ex3-ife-portal.png&quot; alt=&quot;Panasonic Ex3 IFE portal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to build a demo portal that served as a foundation for airlines to build upon. I helped define responsive experience on the portal by re-building the front end and the site structure of the entire site based on previous versions. It also sparked a start to creating a useful content matrix document for developers, project managers and QA to references from by taking an object oriented approach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Worldpay</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/worldpay-intro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Worldpay Intro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;checking-out-the-mobile-payment-process&quot;&gt;Checking out the mobile payment process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worldpay’s payment platform is an easy solution for businesses online to allow customers to checkout. When this project came into light, mobile payment was starting to take off. This is about designing the end of a process rather than the start and getting customers over the last stage of a purchase. Working along side a UX designer and the client, we take a look at all the entry and possible scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/worldpay-wireframes.png&quot; alt=&quot;Worldpay Wireframes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working closely with the client, we identified the scope of devices that the client wish to support, their capabilities and their limitations. From tablet to high end smartphones to low end feature phones, each of their differences had to be documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in place to design the low end, tablet and no-js fall back options. It an interesting challenge, especially on the low end spectrum as there were more limitations to work around, such as the lack of touch interaction and the lack of native javascript support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;covering-the-full-range-of-devices&quot;&gt;Covering the full range of devices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/jonathanyap-site/images/work/worldpay-devices.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Worldpay devices&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The designs were kept to a simple form. This provided the foundation for the payment process, yet also allowing businesses with a little more room to re-style it with their own brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we created a payment process that cover a wide range of devices but still share the same user journey.&lt;/p&gt;
