## In the center of the world payment network

Coming into Visa, I was initially here to setup the Singapore Visa Design Studio with a partner. This was our first ever design home base outside of the US. 1st mac users in the main office is pretty much a statement of disruption we were in for, to cultivate and [innovate much quicker](https://sympli.io/blog/2016/10/04/less-time-specingatvisa/) like a startup within a large organisation.

Most of my projects here, I am not able to publicly share them. What I am able to share is a project mobile payments that is live in multiple markets in Asia, namely [mVisa](http://www.visa.co.in/personal/mvisa/mvisa.shtml). In general, mVisa is about activating the millions of device in Asia, and enabling people with easy frictionless payment experience.

Day-to-day here has been the most interesting and intense learning, with so many great partners to work with. Helping support the innovation within the company has been a key vital point, through supporting effort in the newly launched [Visa Innovation Centre](http://www.visa.com.sg/aboutvisa/innovation/innovationcentre.shtml).

More to come in the futureâ€¦
