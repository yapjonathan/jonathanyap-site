## Building the foundation for entertainment in the skies

The project with Panasonic is a very large scale, long term collaboration which involves a lot of people. I was involved in building the experience from ground up and helped shape the standards for a complex B2B CMS

This started out with the work for building the UI in the Ex3 in-flight entertainment (IFE) system. With the latest version allowing touch interaction and wireless internet in the skies, we could pull in a lot of familiar services for those long hours up in the air.

The project then grew into providing a second screen experience in extension to the back seat IFE. We drew up multiple mini wireframes sets to help create second screen UX for users with tablet devices.

Part of the project is creating an automate process for airline without much additional coding, by building a content management system for site portals. It all starts with a simple logo, with an added bonus of allowing version control.

Followed by a tool to use that is build with speed and performance in mind. This CSS lead design took inspiration from flat design, which fits the criteria of cross browser performance and implementation. It was about designing a tool to build and not hinder performance with bloated UI.

The next step was to build a demo portal that served as a foundation for airlines to build upon. I helped define responsive experience on the portal by re-building the front end and the site structure of the entire site based on previous versions. It also sparked a start to creating a useful content matrix document for developers, project managers and QA to references from by taking an object oriented approach.
