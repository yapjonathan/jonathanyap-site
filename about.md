I always find it to be a tough challenge to describe oneself. If you ask me, I'll probably tell you about my experience as a designer who goes from start to end in a product lifecycle and a little beyond, even if things didn't always [work out](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emotivu).

Someone who loves to dig his hands into the warm sands of culture to discover a gem of a story told from people from time-to-time; like sharing one in a 16-hour train journey halfway across Europe thanks to [Mother Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_eruptions_of_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull).

A person who went through quite a lot to perfect his craft and workflow [with tools](https://sympli.io/blog/2016/10/04/less-time-specingatvisa/), but in time when needed, just stick to the barebones and gets the job done.

One who turn stories into prototype to tell a story, and sometimes gets back into the entanglement of code to try out new ideas.

A hobbyist who spends probably too much on kickstarter, but always out seeking interesting stories for [Digital Ketchup](https://flipboard.com/section/digital-ketchup!-bfbwqm).

So, maybe to sum it up, I'm Jonathan Yap, an explorer of sorts. ðŸ˜„
