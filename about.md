I always find it to be a tough challenge to describe oneself, so let me do a little self exploration to paint a little picture. It'll probably go something like this:

An experienced designer who goes from start to end in a product lifecycle and a little beyond, even if things didn't always [work out](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emotivu).

Someone who loves to dig his hands into the warm sands of culture to discover a gem of a story told by others; i.e sharing one in a 16-hour train journey halfway across Europe thanks to [Mother Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_eruptions_of_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull).

A person who went through quite a lot to perfect his craft and workflow [with tools](https://sympli.io/blog/2016/10/04/less-time-specingatvisa/); but when needed, will stick to the barebones to get the job done.

One who turns insights into prototype to tell a story, and sometimes gets back into the entanglement of code to try out new ideas.

A tech enthusiast who spends probably too much on kickstarter and always out seeking interesting stories for [Digital Ketchup](https://flipboard.com/section/digital-ketchup!-bfbwqm).

So, maybe to sum it up, this is Jonathan Yap, an explorer of sorts. ðŸ˜„
